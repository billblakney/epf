Key preferences
---------------
To save, use the File->Export to bring up the wizard.
Select item "Key Preferences".
Use "Browse..." if you want to change the filename.
Press "Finish".

To load, use "File->Import" to bring up the wizard.
Select "General->Preferences".
Select "Next" to navigate to the desired file, etc.

The keys can also be saved to a csv file from within
the Keys dialog. But there is no way to import it.
Still, I export it just for reference, as it is a readable
file (as opposed to the epf file which is not readable).

Code format preferences
-----------------------
Can use preference files, similar to how "Key preferences"
are described above.
Can alternately use xml files within the dialogs that manage
the code formatting preferences (e.g. one for java and a
different one for cpp).
